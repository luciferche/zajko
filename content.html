                    applicable in practice and have protected the best interests of our clients. 
                    Mostly our assignments include legal due diligence reports, drafting of sale–purchase

                    Additionally, our practice is to inform our clients on all possible legal consequences

                    and, by doing so, we always try to achieve the highest possible level of protection of our 
                    clients’ interests. Often we have protected our clients’ interests by regulating the manner 
                    of management of the companies that were subject to takeovers.
